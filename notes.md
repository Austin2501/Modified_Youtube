## NODEMON

`nodemon` is a utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server. It is a development dependency that helps you save time by automatically restarting your application when changes are detected.

Here's a brief overview of its features:

1. **Automatic Restart**: Nodemon watches the files in the directory where it was started, and if any files are added, changed, or deleted, it will automatically restart your application.

2. **Cross-Platform**: Nodemon is a cross-platform tool, so it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3. **Customization**: Nodemon can be configured to ignore specific files or directories, and you can also specify which file extensions to watch.

4. **Hot Reload**: Nodemon can be used in conjunction with other tools like `webpack` or `babel` to provide hot reloading, which means your application can be updated without a full reload of the page.

To use Nodemon, you need to install it globally or locally in your project:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g nodemon

# Install locally in your project
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```


Then, you can start your application with Nodemon:

```bash
nodemon your_script.js
```


In this command, `your_script.js` is the entry point of your application. Nodemon will start your application and watch for changes in the current directory.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database program. It uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas and is designed to be scalable and flexible with high performance. Here's everything a software developer needs to know about MongoDB:

1. **Document-Oriented**: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. Each document can have a different structure, which makes it very flexible.

2. **NoSQL**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't use the traditional rows and columns of a relational database. Instead, it uses a more flexible model that can be a better fit for certain types of data and certain types of applications.

3. **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed to be scalable. You can easily add more servers to your MongoDB deployment to handle more data and more traffic.

4. **Performance**: MongoDB is designed to be fast. It uses a number of techniques to improve performance, such as in-memory storage, horizontal scaling, and automatic sharding.

5. **Flexibility**: MongoDB is very flexible. You can store any type of data in MongoDB, and you can change the structure of your data at any time.

6. **Community and Ecosystem**: MongoDB has a large and active community, and there are many third-party tools and libraries available that can extend its functionality.

7. **Query Language**: MongoDB uses a query language that is similar to SQL. You can use this language to insert, update, and delete data, as well as to perform more complex operations like aggregations.

8. **Indexes**: MongoDB supports indexes, which can improve the performance of your queries. You can create indexes on any field in your documents.

9. **Replication and High Availability**: MongoDB supports replication and high availability. You can have multiple copies of your data, and if one of your servers goes down, another one can take over.

10. **Security**: MongoDB has a number of security features, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. You can use these features to protect your data.

Here's a simple example of how you can use MongoDB in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
  const uri = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();

    const database = client.db('test');
    const collection = database.collection('test');

    // Insert a document
    await collection.insertOne({ hello: 'world' });

    // Find the document
    const result = await collection.findOne({ hello: 'world' });
    console.log(result);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```



In this code, `MongoClient` is a class that you can use to connect to a MongoDB database. The `connect` method connects to the database, and the `db` method gets a reference to a specific database. The `collection` method gets a reference to a specific collection in the database. The `insertOne` method inserts a document into the collection, and the `findOne` method finds a document in the collection.

## mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks, and more, out of the box. Here's everything a software developer needs to know about Mongoose:

1. **Schema**: Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model your application data. A schema is a blueprint for the data, and it can define the structure of the documents and the types of the fields.

2. **Model**: A model is a class that is used to create, read, update, and delete documents in a specific collection. Each model is associated with a specific collection in the database.

3. **Connection**: Mongoose provides a way to connect to a MongoDB database. You can use the `connect` method to connect to the database, and the `connection` object to get information about the connection.

4. **Validation**: Mongoose provides built-in validation for your data. You can define the types of your fields, and Mongoose will automatically validate your data when you try to save it.

5. **Middleware**: Mongoose provides middleware that can run before or after certain operations. This can be used to add business logic to your models.

6. **Query Building**: Mongoose provides a way to build complex queries. You can use the `find`, `findOne`, `update`, `delete`, and other methods to build your queries.

7. **Population**: Mongoose provides a way to reference other documents in your models. This is called population, and it can be used to create relationships between your models.

8. **Plugins**: Mongoose provides a way to add functionality to your models. You can use the `plugin` method to add a plugin to your model.

Here's a simple example of how you can use Mongoose in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

const kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildjian' });
kitty.save().then(() => console.log('meow'));
```




In this code, `mongoose.connect` connects to a MongoDB database. The `mongoose.model` method creates a model for a collection named 'cats'. The `new Cat` and `kitty.save` lines create a new document in the 'cats' collection.

## multer

`multer` is a Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency. Here's everything a software developer needs to know about `multer`:

1. **File Uploads**: `multer` is used to handle file uploads in Node.js. It can handle both single and multiple file uploads.

2. **Middleware**: `multer` is a middleware, which means it can be used in conjunction with Express or any other Node.js web framework that supports middleware.

3. **Configuration**: `multer` can be configured to specify where to store the uploaded files, what to name the files, and other options.

4. **File Size Limit**: `multer` can be configured to limit the size of the uploaded files.

5. **File Type Validation**: `multer` can be configured to validate the type of the uploaded files.

6. **Error Handling**: `multer` can be used to handle errors that occur during file uploads.

Here's a simple example of how you can use `multer` in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

const app = express();

app.post('/profile', upload.single('avatar'), function (req, res, next) {
  // req.file is the `avatar` file
  // req.body will hold the text fields, if there were any
});

app.listen(3000);
```




In this code, `multer({ dest: 'uploads/' })` creates a new `multer` instance that will store the uploaded files in the 'uploads' directory. The `upload.single('avatar')` middleware is used to handle a single file upload. The file will be available in the `req.file` object.

## cookie-parser

[cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) is a middleware for Express that parses cookies from the request headers and makes them available in `req.cookies`. Here's everything a software developer needs to know about [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27):

1. **Parsing Cookies**: [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) parses cookies from the request headers and makes them available in `req.cookies`.

2. **Signed Cookies**: [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) can also parse signed cookies. A signed cookie is a cookie that has a signature, which can be used to verify that the cookie has not been tampered with.

3. **Configuration**: [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) can be configured to specify the secret used to sign cookies, the options used to parse cookies, and other options.

4. **Error Handling**: [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) can be used to handle errors that occur when parsing cookies.

Here's a simple example of how you can use [cookie-parser](file:///Users/vineetrawat/Desktop/JS_Backend/MegaProject/src/app.js#3%2C27-3%2C27) in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser());

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  // Cookies that have not been signed
  console.log('Cookies: ', req.cookies)

  // Cookies that have been signed
  console.log('Signed Cookies: ', req.signedCookies)
})

app.listen(3000);
```





In this code, `app.use(cookieParser())` adds the `cookie-parser` middleware to the application. The `req.cookies` object contains the cookies that have not been signed, and the `req.signedCookies` object contains the cookies that have been signed.

## Middleware

Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

1. Execute any code.
2. Make changes to the request and the response objects.
3. End the request-response cycle.
4. Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

Here's a simple example of a middleware function:

```javascript
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log('This is my middleware');
  next();
}
```


In this code, `myMiddleware` is a middleware function. It logs a message to the console and then calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function.

You can use middleware functions in Express by adding them to the application using the `app.use` method:

```javascript
app.use(myMiddleware);
```


In this code, `app.use(myMiddleware)` adds `myMiddleware` to the application. Now, `myMiddleware` will be called for every request that the application receives.Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

  console.log('This is my middleware');
  next();
}
```


In this code, `myMiddleware` is a middleware function. It logs a message to the console and then calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function.

You can use middleware functions in Express by adding them to the application using the `app.use` method:

```javascript
app.use(myMiddleware);
```


In this code, `app.use(myMiddleware)` adds `myMiddleware` to the application. Now, `myMiddleware` will be called for every request that the application receives.

## Node.js api errors

In a Node.js API, errors can occur at various stages of the request-response cycle. Here are some common types of errors and how to handle them:

1. **Synchronous Errors**: These are errors that occur during the execution of a synchronous function. You can handle these errors using a `try/catch` block.

```javascript
try {
  // Synchronous code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
}
```


2. **Asynchronous Errors**: These are errors that occur during the execution of an asynchronous function. You can handle these errors using the `catch` method of a `Promise` or the second argument of a callback function.

```javascript
asyncFunction()
  .then(result => {
    // Handle the result
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```


3. **Express Middleware Errors**: These are errors that occur in an Express middleware function. You can handle these errors by passing them to the `next` function.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle the error
});
```


4. **Database Errors**: These are errors that occur when interacting with a database. You can handle these errors by checking the error object returned by the database operation.

```javascript
db.collection('users').insertOne({ name: 'John' }, (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    // Handle the error
  } else {
    // Handle the result
  }
});
```


5. **Custom Errors**: You can also create your own custom errors using the `Error` constructor. This can be useful for throwing errors with specific error codes or messages.

```javascript
throw new Error('This is a custom error');
```


Remember to always handle errors in your Node.js API to prevent your application from crashing and to provide a better user experience.

In Node.js, classes are a way to create objects with similar properties and methods. They are a part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) standard and are used to create reusable code.

In the context of an API, you might use classes to represent different types of errors. For example, you could create a `NotFoundError` class to represent a 404 error, or a `BadRequestError` class to represent a 400 error.

Here's an example of how you might define a `NotFoundError` class:

```javascript
class NotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'NotFoundError';
    this.statusCode = 404;
  }
}
```



And here's how you might use it in your API:

```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  const user = getUserById(req.params.id);
  if (!user) {
    return next(new NotFoundError('User not found'));
  }
  res.json(user);
});
```



In this code, if the `getUserById` function returns `null`, we throw a `NotFoundError`. This error will be caught by the error-handling middleware and a 404 response will be sent to the client.

Using classes to represent errors can make your code more readable and maintainable, and can also make it easier to handle different types of errors in a consistent way.

## server status code

Server status codes are part of the HTTP protocol and are returned by the server in response to a client's request. They provide information about the status of the request.

Here are some common server status codes:

- **1xx (Informational)**: These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is processing it.

  - 100 Continue
  - 101 Switching Protocols

- **2xx (Success)**: These status codes indicate that the request was successful.

  - 200 OK
  - 201 Created
  - 202 Accepted
  - 204 No Content

- **3xx (Redirection)**: These status codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action to complete the request.

  - 301 Moved Permanently
  - 302 Found
  - 304 Not Modified

- **4xx (Client Error)**: These status codes indicate that there was an error in the request.

  - 400 Bad Request
  - 401 Unauthorized
  - 403 Forbidden
  - 404 Not Found
  - 405 Method Not Allowed
  - 409 Conflict
  - 429 Too Many Requests

- **5xx (Server Error)**: These status codes indicate that there was an error on the server.

  - 500 Internal Server Error
  - 501 Not Implemented
  - 502 Bad Gateway
  - 503 Service Unavailable
  - 504 Gateway Timeout

In the context of a Node.js API, you might use these status codes to indicate the result of a request. For example, if a user tries to access a resource they don't have permission to access, you might return a 403 status code. If a user tries to access a resource that doesn't exist, you might return a 404 status code.
